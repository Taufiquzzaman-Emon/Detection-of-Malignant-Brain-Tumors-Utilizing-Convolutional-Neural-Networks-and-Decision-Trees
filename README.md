# Detection-of-Malignant-Brain-Tumors-Utilizing-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Decision-Trees
This project aims to develop an automated system for the detection of malignant brain tumors using advanced machine learning techniques. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from medical imaging data and Decision Trees for classification
