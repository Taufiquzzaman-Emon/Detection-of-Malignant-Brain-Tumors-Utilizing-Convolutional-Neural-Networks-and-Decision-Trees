# Detection-of-Malignant-Brain-Tumors-Utilizing-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Decision-Trees
This project aims to develop an automated system for the detection of malignant brain tumors using advanced machine learning techniques. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from medical imaging data and Decision Trees for classification,this approach seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of tumor detection.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The project begins with the preprocessing of medical images, including normalization, resizing, and augmentation, to improve model robustness.
CNN Architecture: A custom CNN model is designed to extract meaningful features from brain MRI scans, effectively distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant tissues.
Decision Tree Classification: The extracted features are then fed into a Decision Tree classifier, which is trained to make final predictions on the presence of malignant tumors.
Performance Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with comparisons against traditional diagnostic methods.
